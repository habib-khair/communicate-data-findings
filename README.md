Data Wrangling Project: Communicating Data Findings
by Habib Khair
Overview
This project focuses on data wrangling and analysis to investigate relationships between various loan attributes such as loan amounts, monthly payments, APRs (Annual Percentage Rates), and loan terms. The goal is to clean, visualize, and communicate data insights that can help both borrowers and lenders understand key trends in the loan data.

Key Insights
Monthly Payments: The most common monthly payment range for borrowers is between 100-200 USD, indicating a typical repayment pattern.
Loan Amount vs. Monthly Payment: A positive correlation exists between loan amounts and monthly paymentsâ€”larger loans result in higher monthly payments.
APR Trends: Borrowers with larger loan amounts often receive lower APRs, likely due to stronger credit profiles.
Loan Terms: Shorter-term loans (12 months) are linked to smaller loan amounts and higher APRs, while longer-term loans (60 months) are associated with larger loans and lower APRs.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project provides insights into loan amounts, monthly payments, APRs, loan terms, and borrower profiles. The data has been cleaned and analyzed to identify key trends and relationships that can help inform decisions in loan management.

Features
Loan Amount: The original loan amount borrowed by the customer.
Monthly Loan Payment: The monthly repayment amount the borrower must pay.
APR (BorrowerAPR): The annual percentage rate associated with the loan.
Loan Term: The duration of the loan (e.g., 12 months, 60 months).


Conclusion
Through this analysis, we have been able to identify key trends in loan amounts, monthly payments, APRs, and loan terms. The data shows a clear relationship between loan amounts and monthly payments, with larger loans leading to higher monthly payments. Additionally, the APR tends to be lower for larger loans, likely due to better credit profiles. Shorter loan terms are associated with smaller amounts and higher APRs, while longer loan terms typically involve larger loans and lower rates.

These insights can be valuable for both lenders and borrowers when making informed decisions about loan terms, payments, and interest rates.
